# Basic topic of python
# the first topic of python is print and its types
# First we will learn how to print the words

print ("Helloworld")   # This is the example of the helloworld when you run this you will see the output helloworld
print (type("helloworld ")) #when you give the cmd type you will see what the the type of word you are printing
#when you learn the prgoram you will see the "str" it means string type you are printing
# string is defined when it is in alphabets

#String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters.

#Next we will go through the int

print (1)
print (type(1))

# when you run this program you will see the output as 1 and the type is int
# int is also called as integer which is numerical value is printed
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
# and also we can add the int value
# if you give the "+" between two int values then it will be added you can give any operations to do
#example:

print (1+3)
print (1-3)
print (10*5)

# next topic is float

print (1.123)
print (type(1.123))

# when you run this program you will get the output as float
# Float is a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers.
# float is a type where we can defined when there is a decimals.
